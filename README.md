# spis16-webapps-legwork
Things the webapps team needs to do some "legwork" on to be in a better position to help SPISers with their webapp projects.


Feel free to create additional .md files, or put content into this one: but the main reason for this repo to exist is the "issues" list.

Please add issues that need to be worked on, and work on issues that are still open.
